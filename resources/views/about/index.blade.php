              Florida residents know the impact and devastation that natural
              disasters like hurricanes can cause, that is why the importance of
              having a quality roof installed is vital in waiting out the storm.
              KATC Construction is no stranger when it comes to hard
              work and reliability. We have served Hurricane Andrew and
              Hurricane Wilma victims. We were able to survey the damage and
              provide a triage of quality services for families in need.
